        <h2>The Harajuku Moment</h2>
        <p>In life, almost everyone has a moment where they think to themselves, "I've been on autopilot. It's time for a change." That moment can manifest differently for everyone, but the outcomes are the same. You've decided no matter what, you want to choose the path less traveled. To be intentional with your life, and create the sustaniable habits, discipline, and mentality that lead to lasting change. Welcome.</p>

        <h2>How do you know when you've had yours?</h2>
        <p>In the words of my father, "You'll know when you know." - when I was asking about whether or not I'll ever meet "the one." So here are some characteristics for when having your own:</p>
<section>
    <ul>
        <li>You are deeply unsatisfied with your status quo. Something feels like it's been keeping you back, or you've been wasting away your potential.</li>
        <li>A feeling of realization that you can actually do something about it, even if it sucks really, really bad. But your hopefulness to make a change outweighs the fear of despair of the failure.</li>
        <li>You might be looking in the mirror, not recognizing the face staring back at you. Or struggle liffting something that you know just a few years ago you could lift no problem. Walking up the stairs makes you out of breath. It goes on.</li>
    </ul>
</section>
        <h2>Why is the Harajuku Moment needed?</h2>
        <p>"You'll know when you know." If you don't think you need a Harajuku Moment, then you're probably pretty happy with your life, so you can skip all this and go straight to the next article.</p>
