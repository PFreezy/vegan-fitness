        <h2>The Holy Trinity</h2>
        <p>The vast majority of improvements you will make to your health, wellness, and life will be through three primary vehicles: Exercise, Recovery, and Nutrition.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can double click into each of these, and you will find constituent elements that make up these categories.</li>
            <li>Excercise comes in two primary forms: Resistance Training and Aerobic (Cardio)</li>
            <li>Recovery is mostly about sleep (say, 85-90%), but there's other factors that can play into your recovery.</li>
            <li>Nutrition is all about macronutrients, but the really the only one that matters is protein.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Is this really all I have to do?</h2>
        <p>Yes.</p>

        <h2>What's the catch?</h2>
        <p>The catch is you have to do it. There's tools to help you. Information being one of the most important. But if you're not seeing results, it's either because you're not doing the work, or you haven't waited long enough. There's no other outcome. Once you have your Harajuku Moment, you'll learn that discipline is your new best friend, and motivation will be an afterthought.</p>
